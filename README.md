# CODSOFT Python Internship – July 2025

Welcome to my CodSoft Python Programming Internship repository.  
This repo contains all the tasks completed by me as a part of the internship.

## Internship Tasks

Task 1 - To-Do List App
A command-line Python application that allows you to manage your daily tasks: add, view, complete, and delete. Task data is saved using JSON for persistence.

Task 2 - Calculator
A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations. The user can input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to get the result.

Task 3 - Password Generator
This app generates strong, random passwords based on the user's chosen length and complexity.

Task 4 - Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A terminal-based game where you can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. Keeps track of user and computer scores, and allows multiple rounds.

Task 5 - Contact Book
A simple contact manager. Add, view, search, update, and delete contact information (name, phone, email, address) via the command line.
