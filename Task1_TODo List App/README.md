# Task 1 – To-Do List Application

This project is a simple command-line To-Do List app written in Python.  
You can manage your daily tasks: add, view, mark as complete, and delete—right from your terminal.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View all tasks (see which are completed)
- Mark any task as complete
- Delete tasks from your list
- All tasks are saved to tasks.json (persistent storage)

### How It Works

1. Start the app using:  
2. Choose options from the menu:
- Add a task by typing its name.
- View your entire to-do list.
- Mark tasks as complete when finished.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
3. All your tasks remain saved even after you exit—the app auto-saves to tasks.json.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.x (no extra libraries needed)
